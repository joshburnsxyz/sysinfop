# sysinfop
Lightweight system info utility

> Sysinfop is my own attempt at a _Neofetch_ / _Screenfetch_ style cli app. Sysinfop Is built using Python3 and requires both a working
> Python3 install as well as the Poetry build tool available on your system if you are building the project from source. Pre-built `wheel`,
> `sdist`, `.exe` (Windows), and `.app` (MacOS) assets will be available soon...
